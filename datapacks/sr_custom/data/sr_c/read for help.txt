Copy and paste folder "track1" to give yourself more level folders to work with.

The folder name must be "track2", "track3", ... "track99", etc in order for the custom track system to accept it.

For those unfamiliar with functions:
- File names for folders and .mcfunction files must be all lower-case with no spaces.
- You can call functions by doing "function sr_c:foldername/functionname"
- To debug your functions, select "Open output log when Minecraft: Java Edition starts" in the Minecraft launcher and keep an eye out for errors.
